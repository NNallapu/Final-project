# Title: MCS Simulation of Snakes and Ladders game 

## Team Member(s):Nandana Nallapu


# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
Understanding the workings of a Finite State Machine like Snakes and Ladders, and implementing the rules regarding when and how the system moves from one state to another, and what factors affect this state change. The purpose is to look at the questions like what is the minimum number of moves made in the game to finish it, given two players, and to see what is the shortest time to run the game, does the starting player have an advantage, etc

### Hypothesis before running the simulation:

The hypothesis is that there is an average running time for the game and chances of the game going on forever are slim. 

### Simulation's variables of uncertainty

All players start with a single roll die to reach one of the 100 squares. On each trial, there are equal chances of getting a ladder,snake or just a number/snake's tail/ladder's top. After running the simulation a number of time, by dividing the total number of moves by the number of games, we get an estimate for the average number of moves.
